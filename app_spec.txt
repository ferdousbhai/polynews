# Task: Redesign Frontend with Digg-Style Layout

## Overview
Redesign the polynews frontend to emulate the classic Digg aesthetic while maintaining dark mode. Replace the current card-based layout with a link-list style presentation where predictions appear as clickable post titles, similar to Digg's original news aggregator format with voting indicators, metadata inline, and a clean hierarchical structure.

## Requirements
- Replace card grid with vertical list of predictions styled as Digg-style links/posts
- Each prediction displays: headline text as primary link, volume indicator (similar to Digg's vote count badge), probability percentage, and change metrics (1H, 24H, 7D)
- Maintain dark mode color scheme throughout
- Preserve trending section functionality with Digg-appropriate styling
- Keep all existing data points visible but reorganize into Digg's compact, scannable format
- Include subtle category/source indicators if applicable

## Guidelines
- Follow existing code patterns in the React/TypeScript codebase
- Reference classic Digg (pre-v4) design: left-aligned vote/score boxes, title links, compact metadata rows
- Maintain responsive behavior for mobile views
- Keep existing API integration and data fetching logic unchanged
