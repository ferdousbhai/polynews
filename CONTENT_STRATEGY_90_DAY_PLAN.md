- Use content templates to speed up writing

**Contingency:**
- Reduce to 1 blog post/week if needed

**Contingency:**
- Shift focus to high-performing topics
- Create more comparison/data-driven content
- Partner with other prediction market sites for guest posts

### Risk 3: Newsletter Unsubscribe Rate High
**Mitigation:**
- Value-add first (don't oversell)
- Only email once per week
- Personalize content by interest

**Contingency:**
- Offer tiered newsletter (free + premium)
- Move to 2x per week if engagement is high
- Survey unsubscribers for feedback

### Risk 4: SEO Growth Slower Than Expected
**Mitigation:**
- SEO takes 2-3 months to show results (normal)
- Focus on evergreen content, not just news
- Build internal link network intentionally

**Contingency:**
- Invest in paid search (Google Ads) to supplement
