## Strategic Positioning

### Your Unique Market Position

**"What do crowds think will happen? Real-time prediction market intelligence for forecasting decisions."**

**Core Advantages:**
1. **Real-time Polymarket data** (most liquid prediction market - 10-100x more volume than competitors)
2. **Accessible + authoritative content** (only combination: simple UI + expert editorial)
3. **Cross-category coverage** (politics, crypto, sports, economics, tech - competitors focus on one)
4. **Beginner-friendly content** (while Metaculus/PredictIt target specialists)

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Metaculus: Established but dense, limited categories
- PredictIt: Politics-only, declining activity
- CoinGecko: Crypto-only, not prediction-focused
- FiveThirtyEight: Expert models, not crowd intelligence
- **PolyNews:** Crowd wisdom, all categories, real-time, accessible
